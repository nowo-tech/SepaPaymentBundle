# Release process

## Creating a new version (e.g. v1.2.8)

1. **Ensure everything is ready**
   - [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) has the target version with date and full entry; `[Unreleased]` is at the top.
   - [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) (or [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)) has a section "Upgrading to X.Y.Z" with what's new and upgrade steps.
   - Tests pass: `make test` or `composer test`.
   - Code style: `make cs-check` or `composer cs-check`.

2. **Commit and push** any last changes to your default branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Prepare v1.2.8 release"
   git push origin HEAD
   ```

3. **Create and push the tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.8 -m "Release v1.2.8"
   git push origin v1.2.8
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions** (if configured) may create the GitHub Release from the tag.

5. **Packagist** will pick up the new tag; users can then `composer require nowo-tech/sepa-payment-bundle`.

## After releasing

- Keep `[Unreleased]` at the top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the next version.
